\subsection{Overview of Document}
What this document will be touching on are the specific test scenarios that will be used to verify and validate the game as well as the different testing methods that are going to be used in the testing process. The plan will include the specific tools that will be used to create the test scenarios as well as discussing how the functional and non-functional requirements will be tested.

\section{Plan}

\subsection{Software Description}
The software is a recreation of the game Othello with different visuals and features that doesnâ€™t stray from the core rules of the game. The game will allow for the user to choose an AI difficulty level and will play against that AI. The game will be able to show players which moves are valid and which moves are invalid as well as be able to keep track of the score of the game. When the board is filled, the game will declare a winner based on the scoreboard.

\subsection{Test Team}
The team of testers consists of Mohammed Mirakar, Jinesh Patel and Sankar Renganathan. The test cases will be evenly divided among these testers and the testers will be responsible for reporting the results what they tested.

\subsection{Automated Testing Approach}
The \textcolor{blue}{\sout{Jasmine} Jest} framework for JavaScript will be used to develop test cases based on specific inputs and its corresponding outputs. Once these test cases are created, \textcolor{blue}{\sout{Jasmine} Jest} will be used to run automated tests which will then be compiled into a report format that shows us which test cases have passed and which have failed. The results will be based on whether the test cases are able to produce the expected output based on the input. Based on this, the developer team can work on fixing the faults of specific portions of code. Code coverage metrics will also be taken by \textcolor{blue}{\sout{using a third party library integrated with Jasmine called Karma with the necessary plugins that will be determined at a later time} Jest} .

\subsection{Testing Tools}
The tools defined here represent concecptual or physical tools that help or- ganize and execute the processes for different testing procedures.
\begin{itemize}

	\item \textcolor{blue}{\sout{Jasmine which will be used for automated testing as well as Karma for code coverage.}}
	\item \textcolor{blue}{Jest which will be used for automated testing and code coverage.}
	
	\item Visual Studio Code will be used to write and execute test cases as well as for static checking for syntax errors.

	\item White Box Testing:
	      \begin{itemize}
		      \item This procedural method will be used to check individual functionalities in the code implementation of othello such as checking if the move validity function works properly.
	      \end{itemize}

	\item Black Box Testing:
	      \begin{itemize}
		      \item  This process will be used to verify the program without judging the code. This procedure will be used to check the functionality of user interfaces and response times.
	      \end{itemize}

\end{itemize}

\subsection{Testing Schedule}
After every function is created, test cases will be created based on how the function is expected to work. Testing will be done weekly by the entire team. Before the demonstration of the final product, the team will once again test every test case that has been created during the entire testing process. The specific details of the schedule can be seen in the \href{https://gitlab.cas.mcmaster.ca/patelj60/3XA3-G02-Othello/blob/master/ProjectSchedule/3XA3_Project_Plan.pdf}{Gantt chart}.

\end{enumerate}

\section{Tests for Proof of Concept}
The main demonstration for the proof of concept is that the valid moves are determined correctly as these make up the majority of the logic of the Othello game, and that the move's selected by the player and AI correctly change the state board. Since these are the two main functions, they are performed as unit tests for their respective functions in the source code. The rest of the program consists of the integration of the game board with the system controlling the user interface and is thus done as a manual integration test.

\subsection{State}

\paragraph{Validity}

\begin{enumerate}

	\item UT-V-1

	      Type: Functional, Dynamic, Automated, Unit

	      Initial State: There is an instance of a valid board state (predetermined by tester) loaded into the testing system.

	      Input: The input to the 'valid' function is the board state and a cell to check for valid moves for a particular player (player or AI), (predetermined by tester).

	      Output: The output of the valid moves will be a \texttt{true/false} \textcolor{blue}{represented as 0 for \texttt{false} and any other number as \texttt{true}} value.

	      How test will be performed: The test will be performed by comparing the value produced by the 'valid' function with a manually computed \texttt{true/false} value for that particular state.

\end{enumerate}

\paragraph{Moves}

\begin{enumerate}

	\item UT-M-1

	      Type: Functional, Dynamic, Automated, Unit

	      Initial State: There is an instance of a valid board state (predetermined by tester) loaded into the testing system.

	      Input: A virtual player will make a valid move (cell is predetermined by tester).

	      Output: The 'move' function will mutate the board state.

	      How test will be performed: The test will be performed by comparing the new board state produced by the 'move' function with a manually computed board state depending on the move.

\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Game}

\paragraph{Integration}

\begin{enumerate}

	\item UT-I-1

	      Type: Functional, Dynamic, Manual

	      Initial State: The game is loaded into an HTML browser.

	      Input: The tester plays the game and tests the integration of the controls with the game board.

	      Output: The tester shall comment on any bugs found out during the testing period.

	      How test will be performed: The tester shall run through the program attempting to find any bugs with the integration for a set amount of time.

\end{enumerate}

\section{Comparison to Existing Implementation}

The existing implementation of the Othello game does not include a means for automated testing of the program. Thus the only testing method is manual testing where the tester plays the game and validates the integrated functionality of the game.

\section{Unit Testing Plan}

\subsection{Unit testing of internal functions}
Internal functions will be tested based on predetermined inputs and will be validated based on if it produces the corresponding outputs. The white box testing procedure will be used to verify individual functions. The functions will be split into functions that change the state of the game and functions that determine the validity of the game. The state changing functions will have stubs that pretend the game is still valid, and the testing for these functions will be considered a success if the function is able to modify the game board to match the expected output for the game board. For example, if a user places a piece on the top left square, the test will check if the new game board contains the existing pieces plus an additional white piece on the top left square. The validity functions will be called by drivers that represent a certain game board state. The official rules of Othello will help determine if the game state contradicts the rules, which will determine if the test passes or fails. Our goal for test coverage is to aim to test as much relevant code as possible based on the functions being tested. Our team is aiming for at least an 85\% coverage of testing.

\subsection{Unit testing of output files}
{\color{blue}
Currently, the only output file that will be generated will contain all elements that describe the state of the game and will be stored in local storage. Integration testing will be used to test if the file is able to be recovered after exiting the game and unit tests will be used to check if the contents in the file are consistent to when the file was saved.}

\subsection{Symbolic Parameters}

\begin{itemize}
	\item \texttt{ANIM\char`_TIME}: The maximum time it takes to complete all animations regarding actual game play (does not include controls or main/end screen animations).
	\item \texttt{RESP\char`_TIME}: The maximum time it takes to display the new board state to the screen for visual display. This parameter includes the animation timeing and thus \texttt{RESP\char`_TIME} $\geq$ \texttt{ANIM\char`_TIME}.
	\item \texttt{AI\char`_TIME}: The maximum time it takes for the AI to decide and make a valid move according to Othello rules.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Usability Survey Questions?}

\begin{itemize}
	\item How familiar is the user interface compared to other similar board games such as Chess or Checkers?
	\item Is the interaction with the game relatively easy to learn on average compared to other games in a similar category?
	\item How would you rate the usability of the interface on a scale of 1-10?
	\item Did you have any struggles with the user interface, if so, what are they?
	\item Do you think the user interface follows the general style of the modern day online world?
	\color{blue}
	\item What is your win percantage against each AI?
	\item How often do you use the playback feature?
\end{itemize}
